An emotion-based music recommendation system is a type of recommendation system that uses data on a user's emotions or mood to suggest songs that are likely to match their current emotional state. The system can be based on a user's self-reported emotions, or it can use other data such as facial expressions and physiological signals to infer their emotional state.
